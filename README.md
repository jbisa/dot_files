# Dot Files 

This repository contains the bash and git configurations I find helpful for my productivity as a developer.

## Getting Started

Simply download this project and place the dotfiles in your home directory. See the Prerequisites section for installing the necessary dependencies. If you already have a bash terminal open, either close and open a new terminal or run the following to see changes from the config files:

```
source ~/.bash_profile
```

### Prerequisites

In order to get git autocompletion working, download the git-completion.bash script and put it in your home directory:
```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/git/git/master/contrib/completion/git-completion.bash -o ~/.git-completion.bash
```
